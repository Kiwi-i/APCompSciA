<div class="skillConcepts">
        <p>An ArrayList is one of several classes that implement the List interface. As its name suggests, an ArrayList also involves arrays. 
            Basically, everything we learned concerning arrays can also be applied to ArrayList objects, however, with slightly
            different methods.</p>
        <p>While ArrayLists certainly have their advantages over normal arrays, they also have their disadvantages.  These are discussed below.</p>
        <p><u>Advantages</u></p>
        <p>Ordinarily arrays are fixed in size. When we create an array, we anticipate the largest possible
            size it will ever need to be, and when instantiating the array, dimension it to that size. We call this
            the physical size of the array and it always remains that size even though at some point in your
            program you may wish to only use a portion of the array. The size of that portion is called the
            logical size. Your own code must keep up with that size.</p>
                
        <p>By contrast, an ArrayList expands and contracts to meet your needs. If you remove items from or add items to your ArrayList, the
            physical and logical sizes are always identical. This can be very important if you wish to be conservative of memory usage. 
            With memory being so abundant and inexpensive today, this is no longer the advantage it once was.</p>


        <p>Because ArrayLists can be resized at anytime, the <em>add</em> method associated with ArrayLists allows for very easy insertion of new items 
            in the interior of the list without the nuisance of having to pre-move ore remove existing items. </p>
    
        <p>A final advantage of ArrayLists is that iterator objects are provided, which allows for easy traversal of the list.  Normal arrays on the other hand
            must be traversed using loops.
        </p>
        <p><u>Disadvantages</u></p>

        <p>The biggest disadvantage of using ArrayLists over normal arrays is that they can only store objects. 
            If we wish to store primitives such as integers, doubles, or booleans, they must be converted into their object counterpart (more on this later). 
            Similarly, when we retrieve things from an ArrayList, they come out as objects. </p>
        
        <p>“Big deal”, you say....certainly, if we store objects in the list, then we expect to get objects back when we retrieve them from the list. 
            Yes, but it’s worse than one might think. When retrieving an object from a list, it doesn’t come back as the same type object that was originally stored. 
            Rather, it comes back as an Object type object. To use the retrieved element, it will be necessary to cast it down to its original object type (more on this later).</p>

        <div class="skillTakeAway">
            <ul>
                <li>An ArrayList is similar to an Array, but is more flexible and can be resized</li>
                <li>Only objects can be stored in an ArrayList</li>
                <li>An ArrayList implements the List interface</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
</div>
<div id="skill2" class="skills">Skill 27.2 Implement an ArrayList</div>
<div class="skillConceptsHeader">Skill 27.2 Concepts</div>
<div class="skillConcepts">
<p>Before using ArrayLists, you must import the required java packages.  These packages are listed below.  </p>
<div class = "codeblock">

        <p>import java.util.ArrayList;</p>
        <p>import java.util.List;</p>
</div>

<p>Alternatively you can import all the utilities at once using the following,</p>

<div class = "codeblock">
        <p>import java.util.*;</p>
</div>

<p>ArrayLists can be created in two different ways.  </p>

<p>Method 1</p>

<div class = "codeblock">
    <p>ArrayList&#60;String&#62; aryLst = new ArrayList&#60;String&#62;( );</p>
</div>
<p>Method 2</p>

<div class = "codeblock">
    <p>ArrayList&#60;String&#62; aryLst = new ArrayList&#60;&#62;( );</p>
</div>

<p>The &#60;String&#62; parameter indicates that objects we add to the list can only be String types.
(Instead of String we could use any object type.) This insures “type safety” and would result in a
compile time error if we ever tried to add some other type object to aryLst.</p>
<p>Type parameters also remove the burden of casting Object type objects retrieved from a list back
to their original type.</p>

<p>The ArrayList utilities provides a number of useful methods for manipulating our ArrayLists.  These are summarized below. In each case
    we can assume an ArrayList of String elements called <em>aryLst</em> has been declared.
</p>

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>signature</th><th>example</th><th>description</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>void add(Object o)</td><td>aryLst.add("Dog");</td><td>Adds "Dog" to the end of the list</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>void add(int index, Object o)</td><td>aryLst.add(3, "Cat");</td><td>Inserts "Cat" at index 3 after moving the existing object at index 3 and greater up one notch</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Object get(int index)</td><td>String q = aryLst.get(3);</td><td>Retrieve object at position 3</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Object remove(int index)</td><td>String q = aryLst.remove(3);</td><td>Removes object at position 3, then adjusts the size of the list</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Object removeLast( )</td><td>String q = aryLst.removeLast( );</td><td>Removes object at end of list and returns that object</td>
    </tr>    
    <tr>
        <td>Object set(int index, Object o)</td><td>String q = aryLst.set(3, "fish");</td><td>Replaces object at position 3 with "fish" and returns original object</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>boolean isEmpty( )</td><td>aryLst.isEmpty();</td><td>Returns true if there are no objects in the list</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>int size()</td><td>aryLst.size();</td><td>Returns the number of objects in the list</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>void clear()</td><td>aryLst.clear();</td><td>Removes all objects from the list</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>The video below illustrates how these methods can be applied to ArrayLists</p>

<div id="skill3" class="skills">Skill 27.3 Store primitive data types inside an ArrayList</div>
<div class="skillConceptsHeader">Skill 27.3 Concepts</div>
<div class="skillConcepts">
<p>For each primitive data type tyere is a corresponding Object type.</p>
<p>int -> Integer</p>
<p>double -> Double</p>
<p>boolean -> Boolean</p>
<p>Java versions 5 or later support <em>autoboxing</em>, which allows us to easily convert between the primitive and object types.</p>
<p>Consider the examples below, </p>
<div class = "codeblock">
        <p>Integer iObject = 10;<br>
        int iPrimitive = iObject;</p>
        
        <p>Double dObject = 1.1;<br>
        double dPrimitive = dObject;</p>
        
        <p>Boolean bObject = true;<br>
        boolean bPrimitive = bObject;</p>
</div>
<p>Notice that in the above examples we did not need to create a new Object for any of the corresponding primitive object types.  Nor did we have to get
    the value of the object in order to assign it to its corresponding primitive equivalent.  The complete process of creating an Integer object and assigning its value 
    to its primitive equivalent is illustrated below.   Java automatically took care of the extra steps required of creating the Integer Object and getting its value.  
    This process is called <em>autoboxing</em>.
    
</p>

<div class = "codeblock">
    <p>Integer iObject = new Integer(10) //creates an Integer object with a value of 10<br>
        int iPrimitive = Integer.valueOf(iObject); //gets the value of the iObject and assigns it to iPrimitive</p>
</div>

<p>The concept of autoboxing is very useful as it applies to ArrayLists, because recall that ArrayLists <em>can only store objects</em>.  Autoboxing therefore allows us to 
easily create ArrayLists and then convert the values to the required primitive equivalent.</p> 
<p>With autoboxing the below code is valid.</p>

<div class = "codeblock">
        <p>ArrayList&#60;Integer&#62 i = new ArrayList&#60;Integer&#62(); //creates an ArrayList of Integer objects<br>
                i.add(1); //adds 1 to the end of the list <br>
                i.add(2); //adds 2 to the end of the list<br>
                i.add(3); //adds 3 to the end of the list<br>
                int iPrimitive = i.get(0); //assigns the Integer object at position 0 to the primitive iPrimitive</p>
</div>

<p>This concept is further illustrated in the video below</p>

<div id="skill4" class="skills">Skill 27.4 Traverse an ArrayList</div>
<div class="skillConceptsHeader">Skill 27.4 Concepts</div>
<div class="skillConcepts">
<p>ArrayLists can be traversed using the same techniques as normal arrays.  The only differences are how we determine the length of the
    list be traversed and how we retrieve the values. Consider the following example, </p>

<div class = "codeblock">
        <p>ArrayList&#60;Integer&#62 i = new ArrayList&#60;Integer&#62(); //creates an ArrayList of Integer objects<br>
            i.add(1); //adds 1 to the end of the list <br>
            i.add(2); //adds 2 to the end of the list<br>
            i.add(3); //adds 3 to the end of the list<br>
        </p>
        <p>        
            for(int j = 0; j &#60; i.size(); j++){ //size() is used to get the length of the array<br><br>
            System.out.println(i.get(j)); //get() is used to get the value at position j <br><br>
        }</p>


</div>

<p>A modified for-each loop can also be applied to traverse an array.  This technique is illustrated in the code below, </p>
<div class = "codeblock">
        <p>ArrayList&#60;Integer&#62 i = new ArrayList&#60;Integer&#62(); //creates an ArrayList of Integer objects<br>
            i.add(1); //adds 1 to the end of the list <br>
            i.add(2); //adds 2 to the end of the list<br>
            i.add(3); //adds 3 to the end of the list<br>
        </p>
        <p>        
        for(int tempValue : i){ //gets each Integer in ArrayList i and assigns it to tempValue<br><br>
            System.out.println(tempValue); //prints the tempValue <br><br>
        }</p>
</div>

<p>Another important consideration is that because items can be added and removed dyanmically from an ArrayList during a traversal
    objects may be outputted twice or missed entirely. This concept is illustrated further
    in the video below.
