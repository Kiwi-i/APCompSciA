# Blob Hunter

## Introduction
In this lab, you will apply recursion to locate all the buttons in a mine sweeper game that
do not contain mines.  When a button which does not contain a mine is clicked, your program
will check all the adjacent buttons for a mine until a base case is encountered.  All the buttons
that do not contain mines will change color.
