# String Operations

## Introduction
In this lab you will apply methods from the String class to manipulate variables

## Your Tasks

- [ ] Locate the "String Operations" lab guide [StringOperations.pdf](StringOperations.pdf)

- [ ] Complete the group portion of the lab as instructed

- [ ] Complete the individual portion of the lab

	* In your AP Computer Science A Repo on your computer make sure you have created a directory called "labs"
	* Inside your labs directory, create another directory called "StringOperations"
	* Inside the directory you just created, create a java file called StringOperations.java
	* Implement the challenges below
	* Once you have completed your challenges push your AP Computer Science A Repo to GitHub
	* Show your completed challenge to Ms. Pluska to receive credit for the individual portion of this lab

### Challenge 1

- [ ] Your task is to write a word scrambler program.  Your scrambled word program should determine the first half of the word and the last half the word.  The scrambled word should have the last half printed first, followed by the first half.  Consider the following words.
